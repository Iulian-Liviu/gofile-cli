## gofile-cli 

gofile-cli is a command line tool that allows you to easily upload files to the GoFiles service (https://gofile.io/) directly from your Linux terminal. With gofile-cli, you can quickly and easily upload files of any size, without having to navigate through a web interface.

The application is built using C#, which allows for a smooth and efficient experience. It also supports multiple file uploads at once, making it the perfect tool for developers and power users who need to frequently upload files to GoFiles.

**Disclaimer:** gofile-cli is currently in beta, so please use it at your own risk and report any bugs you find to the author.

### Need help 
   Please if you know C# and you want to build something as a first project, please help me.
   I don't have much time because of work, so I look for people who can help.
